[What I Learned Working for Both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs](https://medium.com/@benbob/what-i-learned-from-working-for-both-bill-gates-and-steve-jobs-f0c04e1e5160)

This article is about a man's experience from majoring in Computer Science and entering the industry in the 80s and the eminent growth and change in technology that he's experienced over the years. What I found interesting about the article was reading about the exponential growth of technology in his point of view. He was able to experience an entire generation of computing and from that, see the difference between what it was then and what it is now. 

He writes, "I still have trouble getting my iPhone to work with Google Play when I visit a friend’s home (talk about vendor lock-in) but, once we agree on a platform, we can choose from thousands of movies, millions of songs, and dozens of shared experiences whether we’re in the same room or halfway across the world. Twenty years ago, none of this existed. Now that’s progress and we all had a hand in it. It’s only when you take a giant step backwards and see the impact our industry has had, as a whole, on humanity that you can feel happy about your contributions." From that, the biggest lesson I learnt is that even though sometimes it may seem like you're not doing much, where you could be taking months (or maybe even years) to develop one simple program. However, the overall impact of software engineering is extensive. 


I find the line, "you’re not bored because the topic is boring. Chances are you’re bored because you don’t understand it" very truthful as any subject has interesting aspects to everyone. - Eric Wu
